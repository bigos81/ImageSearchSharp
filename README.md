1. Do you like https://github.com/drov0/python-imagesearch?
2. Do you prefer .NET and C#?
3. Are you only targetting Windows?

If the aswer for all 3 above is yes, then here you go, here are the ported functions:
- find image in image (best match)
- find image(s) in image (all above the treshold)

to a .NET lib, so now you can use the openCV goodness in your windows .NET apps. Also added a freebee - a function for capturing the screen from your primary monitor (just like pyautogui does).

Have fun!
